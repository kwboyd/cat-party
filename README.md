# CAT PARTY

## This is a JavaScript/React app that lets you breed ASCII Cats. Uses React Testing Library for testing.

### Rules:
1. Each cat has two genes for eyes, nose, and whiskers.
2. Some genes are recessive and some are dominant (dominant genes shown in bold/italic).
3. Dominant genes will show over recessive ones.
4. A mix of two dominant or two recessive will show as a unique combination of those two genes.
5. You can pick two cats to breed. Their kitten will inherit a random combination of their genes.
6. Names, poses, and sex are random!
7. Want some fresh genes? Generate a random cat.

### Run/Build/Test
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run dev with `npm run start`
3. Build with `npm run build`
4. Test with `npm run test`
